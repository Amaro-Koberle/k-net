# The Knowledge Network

![Prototype Screenshot](/readme-images/screenshot.png)

K-net (working title) is a social media web app that puts the relationship between different pieces of content front and center. All posts are rendered in a 3D graph-visualisation, each node and link in the graph represents a post.

## Prototype in Progress

I have barely gotten started with this project, so don't expect much at this point.

You can find a hosted version of the prototype linked below - expect bugs and crashes

### [Live Demo](https://quizzical-edison-523c55.netlify.app/)

## Technologies

This repo is split up into a front-end and a back-end, each is its own npm package with its own dependencies.
